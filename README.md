### A little about myself

I am an evolutionary biologist, and a curious person by nature, always seeking to answer questions. I am currently doing my postdoc in the US (Temple University, Philadelphia). 

I am interested in understanding the underlying causes of cancer metastasis. Molecular evolution provides the necessary theoretical basis for studying somatic evolution 
of cancerous cells, and by consequence, of tumors spread (metastasis). I am currently investigating theoretical concepts and methods from molecular evolution and biogeography in metastatic processes evolved within a patient (tumor biogeography).
