### A little about myself

I am an evolutionary biologist, and a curious person by nature, always seeking to answer questions. I am currently doing my postdoc in the US (Temple University, Philadelphia, [http://igem.temple.edu/](http://igem.temple.edu/)). 
I am interested in understanding the underlying causes of cancer metastasis. Molecular evolution provides the necessary theoretical basis for studying somatic evolution 
of cancerous cells, and by consequence, of tumors spread (metastasis). I am applying the principles of molecular evolution and organismal biogeography to cancers and tumors. 
It is becoming a fascinating area, with the growing awareness that cancer is an evolutionary disease and that the study of tumor evolution is a big key.
