### A little about myself

I am an evolutionary biologist, and a curious person by nature, always seeking to answer questions. During my undergraduate studies I crashed on my first course in evolution, and it was love at first sight! Ever since a fascinating journey on science has started for me, and driven me to Italy, France, Serbia, and lately, US. 
I am currently a postdoctoral fellow working with Dr. Sudhir Kumar [http://www.kumarlab.net/](http://www.kumarlab.net/). 
My expertise lies in molecular evolution, phylogenetics, bioinformatics, molecular ecology, and organismal biogeography. 


My research focus on cancer metastasis, investigating factors underlying tumor heterogeneity and its interaction with the microenvironment. 
Molecular evolution provides the necessary theoretical basis for studying somatic evolution of cancerous cells, and by consequence, of tumors spread (metastasis). 
I utilize the power of evolutionary and phylogenetic inference to reveal the origin and trajectory of cancer cells between tumors within a cancer patient from simulated and patient clinical data.
I am currently translating theoretical concepts and methods from molecular evolution and organismal biogeography in metastatic processes evolved within a patient (tumor biogeography).


I have co-developed PathFinder, a computational method that uses the clone phylogeny, their genetic differentiation, and anatomical locations to infer cancer's migration history in a patient. [https://europepmc.org/article/ppr/ppr186392](https://europepmc.org/article/ppr/ppr186392)
