### A little about myself


I am a curious person by nature, always seeking to answer questions. During my undergraduate studies I crashed on my first course in evolution, and it was love at first sight! Ever since a fascinating journey on science has started for me, and driven me from Greece to Italy, France, Serbia, and lately, the US. 


I have extensive experience on research projects about genomic heterogeneity and migration of organisms and cancer cells. I have introduced new conceptual (Tumor Island Biogeography theory) and computational (PathFinder for inferring metastatic migrations of tumor clones) approaches advancing the cancer field.

I am currently investigating the underlying mechanisms that drive evolution and shape the microenvironment of cancer cells. In that pursuit, I apply computational frameworks for single cell data analysis (RNA-Seq, CITE-Seq, TCR-Seq) in the context of investigating leukemia transcriptomics and epigenetics.
