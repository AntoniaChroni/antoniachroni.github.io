### A little about myself


My natural curiosity and passion about science have led me into cancer research. During my undergraduate studies I crashed on my first course in evolution, and it was love at first sight! Ever since a fascinating journey on science has started for me, and driven me from Greece to Italy, France, Serbia, and lately, the US. 


I have extensive experience in projects about tumor evolution and microenvironment in the context of disease progression. I have developed conceptual frameworks (Tumor Island Biogeography theory), a computational approach (PathFinder), and computational frameworks for data analysis of WGS/WES, sc-RNA-Seq, sc-TCR/BCR-Seq, and sc-ATAC-Seq data.
